Introduction
============
This plugin contains all the plugins distributed by the core holland 
distribution. The backup plugins are all directly dependent on the
main holland distribution (located one level up from this directory).
The library plugins are typically self contained but usually
provide functionality directly applicable to the holland project
and are often dependencies of one or more backup plugins.
